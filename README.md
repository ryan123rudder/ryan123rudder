Hello! My name is Ryan Manley. I’m interested in Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Flight Software, and I’m currently studying Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. I'm also an undergraduate research studying robotic space exploration with Frankie Zhu's RoSE Lab.

My Github is a collection of personal and group projects. Most of them have to remain private unfortunately.

Public code I've written is also found on the @RoSE-Lab-Admin page, most noteably in the perception repository.
