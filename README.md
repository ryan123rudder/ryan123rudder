Hello! My name is Ryan Manley. I’m interested in Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Flight Software, and I’m currently studying Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines.

My Github is a collection of personal and group projects. Most of them have to remain private unfortunately.

Public code I've written is also found on the @Team4388 page, most noteably code regarding the turret, Limelight camera, and autonomous pathing.
