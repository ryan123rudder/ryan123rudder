<h1>Hey, I'm Ryan</h1>

I'm an computer science student who likes building stuff that moves, senses, or communicates. Most of my projects involve some mix of robotics, embedded systems, and software. Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for hardware!

<h2>What I like</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Building robots that can do interesting things</li>
  <li>Playing around with radios and sensors, both on the ground and in space</li>
  <li>Writing firmware and trying to make things actually work in the real world</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Projects</h2>
Some of the things Iâ€™ve worked on include:
 <ul>
  <li>Multi-LiDAR mapping</li>
  <li>CubeSats</li>
  <li>A hopping lunar lander concept for a NASA competition (won 3rd!)</li>
  <li> Random side builds like a driven directonal antenna and a shoulder sitting robot pets</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Tools I use a lot </h2> 
 <ul>
  <li>Python, C++ </li>
  <li>ROS 2, OpenCV, Open3D</li>
  <li>Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and whatever sensor I can get my hands on</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Outside of code ðŸ“¡</h2>
When Iâ€™m not working on a project, Iâ€™m hiking, climbing, looking at the stars with my telescope, or somewhere with no signal.

Nice to meet you!
